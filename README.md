# Employee-Tracker

Your challenge this week is to build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. 

AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business


GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 

Getting Started
You’ll need to use the MySQL2 package (Links to an external site.) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the Inquirer package (Links to an external site.) to interact with the user via the command-line, and the console.table package (Links to an external site.) to print MySQL rows to the console.

You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a .promise() function on Connections to “upgrade” an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. Look into MySQL2's documentation (Links to an external site.) to make your queries asynchronous.

Design the database schema as shown in the following image:

As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

Department

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

name: VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

Role

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

title: VARCHAR(30) to hold role title

salary: DECIMAL to hold role salary

department_id: INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

Employee

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

first_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name

last_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name

role_id: INT to hold reference to employee role

manager_id: INT to hold reference to another employee that is manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager.

You may want to use a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You may also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database. This will make the development of individual features much easier.
